BookWorld prides itself on providing a seamless and secure shopping experience for book enthusiasts around the globe. Recently, you've been tasked with reinforcing the company's cybersecurity posture, monitoring network traffic, and ensuring that the digital environment remains safe from threats.\n",

This anomaly raises concerns about the integrity of BookWorld's customer data and internal systems, prompting an immediate and thorough investigation.\n",

Your objectives include identifying the attack vector, assessing the scope of any potential data breach, and determining if the attacker gained further access to BookWorld's internal systems.\n",
